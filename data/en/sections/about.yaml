summary: >
  I love diving into tricky problems and building things that actually work well at scale.


  Most of my work involves backend systems and DevOps - making sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.


  When I'm not working, you'll find me tinkering with side projects, from web apps to automation tools and my homelab setup.

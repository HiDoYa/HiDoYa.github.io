# Portfolio
My portfolio website for my projects and experience. Accessible at [hiroyagojo.com](https://hiroyagojo.com)

Built using the static site generator Hugo and the 'Toha' theme.

Uses github actions so when changes are made to the source branch, the site is built new and deployed onto github pages.

Note: The recommended git submodules have been removed since I've made several modifications to the base theme which I'd rather not check in to the main project.
